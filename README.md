### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<!--
**jtruong97/jtruong97** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I grew up in San Francisco, CA but recently relocated to Sacramento, CA. I have a background in health care working as a medical assistant in primary care, pediatrics, urology, and obstetrics and gynecology. As much as I loved working in healthcare, I realized it wasn't for me. I started my journey as a software developer at App Academy which fostered my growth and interest in web development. 

Iâ€™m currently working on [Amazonian](https://amazonian-blt9.onrender.com/), a full-stack clone of 'Amazon' featuring my favorite house plants ðŸŒ±.
You can also check out my [portfolio](https://jtruong97.github.io/) to see what else I have been working on! 

I love to travel to learn about other cultures and try new cuisines. I am a huge foodie and always have a running list of new restaurants to try with my friends and family. To unwind at home, I enjoy binge-watching TV shows, playing cozy games on my Switch, and experimenting with new recipes I find on TikTok.
